Physics PhD at UC Berkeley. I work on quantum aspects of spacetime.

I am a doctoral researcher in theoretical physics working with [Geoff Penington](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/geoff-penington). Prior to this, I obtained my undergraduate degree in both Mathematics and Physics from MIT and worked with [Hong Liu](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/hong-liu/) (my thesis advisor) and [Xiao-Gang Wen](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/xiao-gang-wen/).

My research spans quantum gravity, holography, and quantum many-body systems, with a particular focus on:
- Quantum gravity and holography
- Quantum information in many-body systems
- Black hole physics

I recently find AI alignment research interesting and have been exploring.
