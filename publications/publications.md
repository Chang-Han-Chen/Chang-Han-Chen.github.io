## Research Papers

1. **A clock is just a way to tell the time: gravitational algebras in cosmological spacetimes** (2024)  
   Chang-Han Chen (UC, Berkeley), Geoff Penington (UC, Berkeley)  
   arXiv: [2406.02116](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02116) [hep-th]   
   
   We study how gravitational algebras behave in cosmological spacetimes, particularly focusing on de Sitter space. Our work demonstrates that the algebras associated with different time slices are all isomorphic, suggesting that the choice of time slice is essentially arbitrary. This provides new insights into the quantum nature of de Sitter space and has implications for our understanding of cosmological horizons.

2. **Firewalls at exponentially late times** (2024)  
   Andreas Blommaert (SISSA, Trieste), Chang-Han Chen (UC, Berkeley and LBL, Berkeley), Yasunori Nomura (UC, Berkeley and LBL, Berkeley and Wako, RIKEN and Tokyo U., IPMU)  
   Published in: *JHEP 10 (2024) 131*  
   arXiv: [2403.07049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07049) [hep-th]  
   
   We investigate the late-time behavior of black hole firewalls in AdS/CFT. Our findings reveal that firewalls can persist at exponentially late times, challenging previous assumptions about their temporal evolution. This work has important implications for the black hole information paradox and the nature of quantum gravity.

3. **Geometry and entanglement in AdS/CFT and beyond** (2022)  
   Chang-Han Chen (MIT)  

   
   This thesis work explores the deep connection between quantum entanglement and geometric structures in holographic theories. We investigate how quantum information concepts can illuminate our understanding of spacetime emergence, with particular focus on extending these ideas beyond the traditional AdS/CFT correspondence.

5. **The boundaries of 2+1D fermionic topological orders** (2022)  
   Chang-Han Chen, Xiao-Gang Wen  
   arXiv: [2204.06589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06589) [cond-mat.str-el]    
   
   We develop a systematic approach to classify and understand the boundary theories of fermionic topological orders in 2+1 dimensions. Our work provides a complete characterization of possible boundary states and establishes new mathematical structures underlying these topological phases, with implications for both condensed matter physics and quantum computing.
